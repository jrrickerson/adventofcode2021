# Advent of Code 2021
Advent of Code puzzles and solutions for 2021: https://adventofcode.com/2021


## How to Use this Repo
This repository is primarily intended to store my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles.  I have attempted to make this repository self-sufficient - copies of the puzzle text and input data from my specific account have been included for clarity.  Don't forget, my input values will be different from your input values!

### Repo Structure
```
/ - License, README, and dependency / config files
/puzzles - Language agnostic puzzle text and input data
    day-NN.txt - Puzzle text for each day (parts 1 and 2)
    day-NN.input - Puzzle data / input text file for each day
/python - Python language-specific directory for configuration and solutions
    /python/day-NN - Python code solution for each day
/<language> - Other language specific directory for configuration and solutions
    /<language>/day-NN - Other language specific code solution for each day
```

Note that additional language solutions (if any) will appear in language specific directories with the same structure.  See each language-specific directory README for additional details on configuration and use of that directory structure.
